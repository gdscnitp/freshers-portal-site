                <p class="anam-pa">National Institute of Technology Patna is the 18th National Institute of Technology created by the Ministry of H.R.D. Government of India after rechristening the erstwhile Bihar College of Engineering Patna on 28. 01. 2004. NIT Patna marked its humble beginning in 1886 with the establishment of pleaders survey training school which was subsequently promoted of Bihar College of Engineering Patna in 1924. This made this institute the 6th Oldest Engineering Institute of India. The graduate level curriculum was later elevated to the post graduate level in 1978. The institute is situated on the south bank of holy river Ganges behind Gandhi Ghat, one of the most important and reverential place of Patna. The Gandhi Ghat is associated with the immersion of ashes of father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi in the river Ganges. The campus has a picturesque river view with historic building presenting a spectacle of architectural delight and natural beauty.

  <div id="cse"><strong><div id="header">The Department of Computer Science & Engineering</div></strong> offers courses leading to Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering.
  The department has a very good infrastructure and faculty to provide excellent education.The Department of Computer Science and Engineering with its cohesive team of faculty members, 
  offers a sound program at the UG as well as the PG levels. The curriculum is a blend of the conventional and the radical. It is updated regularly to keep up with the growing demands 
  and the changing trends of the software industry and research laboratories. The curriculum is updated regularly to keep up with the growing demands and the changing The department 
  provides a wide range of courses. The prominent among them includes Data Structures, Design and Analysis of Algorithms, System Programming, Computer Networks, Data Mining and Warehousing,
  Distributed and Parallel Computing, Mobile and Wireless Computing, Real-time Systems, Cryptography, Genetic Algorithm and Artificial Intelligence. Apart from these, students are also 
  offered a wide variety of electives. Mission of the department is to  impart  knowledge  in  the  state  of  art  in  Computer Science and Engineering  with relevant theoretical basis,
  to  impart  knowledge  in  the  state  of  art  in  Computer Science and Engineering .</div>
  
  <div id="ece"><strong><div id="header">The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering</div></strong> is one of the established and largest department in the institute. 
  It was established in the year 1978 with an intake of 10 students only. The Department offers B. Tech programme in "Electronics & Communication
  Engineering" with 141 intake capacity, and M.Tech programme in "Communication System, Microelectronics and VLSI System Design" with 18
  intake capacity for each specialization. The department is also offering Ph.D. program (Full time and Part time research program) in
  Electronics and Communication Engineering since 2012 provides a platform for bright graduates and postgraduates to conduct research in the following areas:
 1.	High Power RF / Microwave Devices, Circuits and Systems. RF MEMs, Metamaterial devices, Microwave Imaging and Remote Sensing, Absorber, Dielectric.

 </div>  
  
  <div id="ee"><strong><div id="header">The Department of Electrical Engineering</div></strong> was established in 1945 under Patna University with an intake of 20 students leading to Bachelor of Science (Engineering)
  degree of four year duration. The four year course was later changed to five year integrated course in 1960 with intake of 30 students and it continued up to 1972.
  Again four year course was introduced in 1972 with the same intake capacity of 30 students. The intake was increased from 30 to 40 students in 2005-06 sessions and further
  in 2006-07 the intake capacity has been increased to 60 students.
 
The Microprocessor Laboratory and Power electronics laboratory were setup to meet the requirement of course curriculum and research activity. The advancement and application
 of electronics and microcomputer in the field of electrical engineering necessitated a major revision of the syllabus for the UG program in 1977. A course in Microprocessor was 
 introduced along with many subjects in electronics leading to orientation required for the modem technology, such as Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics, Introduction to Communication 
 and Digital Signal Processing.
  The Electrical Engineering department has well qualified faculty, majority of them are with Ph. D and M. Tech degree 
  with specialization in the field of electrical power, control system and microcomputer based instrumentation & control. The department has well qualified panel of visiting faculty . 
</div>
  <div id="ce"><strong><div id="header">The Department of Civil Engineering</div></strong> is the oldest and vibrant department of the institute, which was established along with the inception of the Institute
  in the year 1924. The Institute was formerly known as the Bihar College of Engineering Patna, a constituent engineering college under Patna University, until 27thJan 2004.
  It was rechristened to National Institute of Technology Patna on 28th Jan 2004 as an Autonomous Institute under MHRD, Govt. of India.
The Department of Civil Engineering is committed to provide quality teaching and research opportunities toits undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral students. Apart from UG programme,
 the department also offers M. Tech and Doctoral programmes in the areas of Structural Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Water Resource Engineering, Environmental Engineering

  with limited capacity, running a modest Ph.D. program and offering B. Tech. chemistry course to UG students. In the past 3-4 years the department has seen a lot of expansion,
  and with increasing faculty strength the number of UG courses offered to B. Tech students has increased. Also, the department's own teaching program, 5 year Integrated M.Sc.
  in Chemistry, has been started in the current academic year (2015-16), and research activity is gradually being expanded. The department has been and will remain committed to quality teaching </div>
  
  <div id="arch"><strong><div id="header">The Department of Architecture</div></strong> is one of the oldest Department of the Institute, which was established in the year 1979. The Department offers undergraduate program in architecture,
  Post graduate program in Urban and Regional Planning and Doctoral program. It is committed to provide quality teaching and research opportunities to its student.
Program Education Objectives (PEO's)
The department is dedicated to producing intellectuals and professionals who are well-versed in the state-of-the-art techniques and requisite skills of the profession. The programme also inculcates
 humanist ideas, community values and team spirit to motivate and stimulate creativity. To understand these objectives, architecture is taught as a serious, exploratory and creative attempt that
 embraces both the humanities and the sciences.

Program Outcomes (PO's)
•	An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering to provide architectural Solution with respect to built and open spaces.
•	An ability to identify, formulate, design and search alternatives, as well as to analyse and interpret data and demographics.
